# push-sixel
a quick sixel demo that plays mod music while displaying an image. requires a sixel-compatible terminal (such as **mlterm** or **yaft**) to run properly.

## What does this thing need?

- libmikmod (for the .it module playback)
- libsixel (for the ***fancy*** graphics)
- python (preferably 3.9/3.10)
- some basic UNIX knowledge
- a IBM Personal Computer with a amd64 processor
- a power supply (probably a central power grid)
- a brain
- a body (works best with humanoids)
- a three-dimensional universe

and that's probably it

## Why tho?

sixel was a thing for about 30 years and most terminals still haven't implemented it. sixel support would be vital to any X-less workflows (yes, some people use computers like that, i would've want to at least) but most software maintainers can't see how it could change how we use PCs, or just don't care.

big, old and bloated xterm is still one of the best terminals in the linux world. how did that happened?
